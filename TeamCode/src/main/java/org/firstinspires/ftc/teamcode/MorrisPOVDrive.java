/*
 * This OpMode illustrates how to use an external "hardware" class to modularize all the robot's sensors and actuators.
 * This approach is very efficient because the same hardware class can be used by all of your teleop and autonomous OpModes
 * without requiring many copy & paste operations.  Once you have defined and tested the hardware class with one OpMode,
 * it is instantly available to other OpModes.
 *
 * The real benefit of this approach is that as you tweak your robot hardware, you only need to make changes in ONE place (the Hardware Class).
 * So, to be effective you should put as much or your hardware setup and access code as possible in the hardware class.
 * Essentially anything you do with hardware in BOTH Teleop and Auto should likely go in the hardware class.
 *
 * The Hardware Class is created in a separate file, and then an "instance" of this class is created in each OpMode.
 * In order for the class to do typical OpMode things (like send telemetry data) it must be passed a reference to the
 * OpMode object when it's created, so it can access all core OpMode functions.  This is illustrated below.
 *
 * In this concept sample, the hardware class file is called org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.RobotHardware.java and it must accompany this sample OpMode.
 * So, if you copy org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.MorrisPOVDrive.java into TeamCode (using Android Studio or OnBotJava) then org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.RobotHardware.java
 * must also be copied to the same location (maintaining its name).

/**
 * Mr. Morris:          TO DO:  1) Test, then revise code for arm, lift, gripper, and wrist
 *                              2) Write code for presets for arm rotation, lift, etc. An automated hang sequence is especially needed.
 *                              3) Once second lift motor is installed - Implement code in RobotHardware
 *                              4) Change code when active intake and color sensor is implemented
 *                              5) Revise code for vision, commented out for now.
 *                              6) Migrate code to Iterative program so that end game behavior can be set - i.e. the hang mechanism can stay engaged for several seconds after stop.
 *                              7) Consider implementing Driver-centric toggle
 *                              8) Set up code for hardware limit switches for arm and lift
 *
 *     COMPLETE, NEEDS TESTING: 1) Finish updating to match RobotHardware file definitions, then delete or comment out @Disabled
 *                              3) Use math to keep wrist turned so that gripper is level with ground (rotate relative to arm rotation)
 *                              4) Add elapsed time tracking and implement better button press delay method. See <a href="https://stemrobotics.cs.pdx.edu/node/7262.html">...</a>
